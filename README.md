# CSE470
CSE470 is an introductory course on Fuzzy Logic, which was offered by [Dr. Mohammad Rashedur Rahman](http://ece.northsouth.edu/people/rashedur-rahman/) sir during Spring 2018 semester at North South University, Dhaka, Bangladesh.
<br/>
As part of the course, we (my group-mates and I) had to implement a project based on fuzzy logic theory. Our project was a secondary school recommendation system. This system
- takes user's preference of criteria of schools and student's information as input
- uses Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (Fuzzy AHP) to evaluate weights of each criteria
- takes data from a dataset on secondary schools of Bangladesh and runs Fuzzy AHP to calculate comparative values of each criterion
- gives the schools a score, a sum of weighted criteria-values.
<br/>

Our project was implemented in Matlab, but I am personally implementing the process in Python. This repository will only contain my Python code.<br/>
The dataset can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dz5p4MJfGdoknAgGRy-BaV0rmX46mZHZ).
